## EXPERIENCE

### **Zeromax INC, Naperville, IL -** *Software developer* <br>

**July 2019 - July 2021   <br>
Amazon Relay Autobook** (JavaScript, Bash, Python, Flask, AWS EC2, HTML, CSS) [Github ](https://github.com/Durbek-Gafur/autobook.git)*Autobook is an extension for the Amazon relay app, it allows carriers to book posted loads faster than the other carriers.*
- Developed a JavaScript extension for the website to dynamically update the content and check for particular load and book it instantly.
- Increased performance of the app by 5x by translating the code into **Linux Bash Script** and migrating the app to **AWS** to decrease **propagation delay.** Developed master-slave architechture, where main node orchestrates child nodes to send requests sequentially in order to avoid being blocked.
- Decreased Time to first byte (**TTFB**) to **40-50 ms** by manipulating the request's session object and **continuous development.**

**Loadboard** (Google Apps Script) [Github ](https://github.com/Durbek-Gafur/ZMXC-loadboard.git)*Loadboard is an extension for Google Sheets, it allows carriers to manage and monitor trips,assets and drivers.*
- Used **Google Maps API** to retrieve longitude,latitude to give estimated time of arrival for trucks on the road.
- Connected **TelegramBot** to google spreadsheets to send periodic updates to telegram chats.
- Created **custom sorting** of rows according to the needs of the company.![](Aspose.Words.3b577c65-31d7-4b66-8e33-4d249198f8f0.003.png)

**January 2022 - Present**
- Worked closely with Professors and Ph.D students to create an Online Learning Platform for **Application-Inspired Cloud** and **DevOps** Curriculum.
- Created a testbed for the research experiments. Set up **Jetson Nano and TX2** to serve as an edge device and established an ad-hoc network for communication among edges.
- Experimented with different network protocols for video streaming. Used **RL algorithm** to better pick the right network protocol and appropriate configurations on dynamically changing environments.![](Aspose.Words.3b577c65-31d7-4b66-8e33-4d249198f8f0.004.png)
